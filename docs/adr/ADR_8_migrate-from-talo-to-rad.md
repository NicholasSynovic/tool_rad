# 8. Migrate from talo to rad

## Context

`talo` is an open source tool to manage ADRs.

`rad` (this tool) replicates features of `talo` on a smaller scale.

## Decision

`rad` is in a state to accomplish the basic tasks of `talo` (creating new adrs).

We will migrate to using `rad` to handle the development of `rad`.

## Consequences

We will still keep the original `talo` ADRs, but leverage this tool going
forward.
