## Context

To configure a project to leverage RAD, the top level directory needs to have a
`.rad` file that configures the location of where ADRs are stored.

## Decision

The fields within the `.rad` file are meant to be as bare bones as possible:

- `.rad` content is written as a YAML file
- The configuration options are limited to:
  - *adr_directory*

## Consequences

Similar to the Python code formatter `black`, there is intentionally little for
the user to modify at this time.

Thus, the compiled application will have to drive most of the decisions.
